KFF Frontend Framework
======================

KFF is an MVC-like JavaScript framework for building client-side applications or large websites in a more structured way. Depends on JQuery (or Zepto) for DOM manipulation.

Main features:

* Declarative view hierarchy (nested views built from data-attributes)
* Observable models and collections (through get/set methods and event system)
* Dependency injection container
* Two way (or one-way) declarative data-binding. Unlimited bindings per HTML element. Unlimited bindings per model attribute.
* Collection data binding - bind a collection to an HTML element like a regular model and it will be automagically repeated for each item in the collection. Filtering supported. Nesting of collection/model bindings supported.
* Front controller, router and PageViews for building single-page applications
* Stacked PageViews allows for navigating inside a single-page application with rendering/destroying shared parts of GUI.
